// Exercise 16-3: Using the speed( ) method in the Movie class, write a program where the user can control the playback speed of a movie with the mouse. Note speed( ) takes one argument and multiplies the movie playback rate by that value. Multiplying by 0.5 will cause the movie to play half as fast, by 2, twice as fast, by -2, twice as fast in reverse, and so on.
